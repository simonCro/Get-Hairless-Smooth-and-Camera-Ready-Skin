# Get-Hairless-Smooth-and-Camera-Ready-Skin
Nobody likes to look or feel the hairy skin. Not just the looks, hair removal has now become the very essential part of our lives, for the sake of personal hygiene. We all dream of smooth, scar-free and hairless skin. And trust us when we say this, it is not possible to go through the pain of waxing every now and then and not to point out the amount of money you spend on your high-end salons and spas or using pricy chemicals and not to forget the pain of plucking them but whatever you do, all of these options are temporary and sticks to maximum for a week or two. Hair removal is one of the biggest concerns of all women and men too. And life is so much easier when you don’t have to worry about shaving and waxing the unwanted hair from your body. The most effective solution to detach the hair is Laser treatment. It is not only easy but has said to give wonderful results as well.  But what do we do? We women can’t just roam here and there with hairy arms and legs. Smoothus Medical Spa brings the solution for your unwanted facial and body hair troubles, Laser Hair Removal. We use The High Speed LightSheer DUET laser system for permanent hair reduction, fast and effective treatment with ease and comfort and without using topicals.  The High Speed LightSheer DUET is a laser that produces a larger beam of highly concentrated light. The light released is well-absorbed by the pigment located in the hair follicles. During this procedure the laser pulses for a fraction of a second, allows the hair to absorb the light and heat. And as it heats up, the hair shaft and bulb are damaged which significantly impedes its ability to re-grow. And with the large spot size, the process treats numerous hair follicles simultaneously, making the treatment significantly faster than traditional laser hair removal alternatives. Being quick, effective and easy is what makes this treatment very popular and highly recommended by the people who have used it. So give a gift of hairless and smooth skin to yourself this Christmas!!! Be ready to enjoy you holidays with more confidence and comfort! Be beautiful! Be you!
